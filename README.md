# Aerial-Car-Detection-using-YOLOv3

This repository contains code for detecting cars in aerial imagery using YOLOv3, a popular object detection algorithm. The code is written in Python and utilizes the cv2 library.

# Requirements
- Python 3.5 or higher
- OpenCV
- Numpy

# Usage
To use the code, clone this repository and navigate to the directory. Then, run the following command:

```Copy code
python detect.py --input path/to/input/image --output path/to/output/image
```
Replace path/to/input/image with the file path to the input image and path/to/output/image with the file path to the output image. The output image will show the input image with bounding boxes drawn around detected cars.

# Credits
This code was heavily influenced by the tutorial on object detection using YOLOv3 available at https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/.
